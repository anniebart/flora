# âœ¿ Planted

###  A static site generator using [sustainable web development practices](https://github.com/lowtechmag/solar/wiki/Solar-Web-Design). 

After learning more about how sustainability intersects with web development, I set off to redesign my own portfolio with sustainable design practices in mind. Though I've used static site generators before (my [blog](https://anniebartblog.netlify.app/) uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)), I thought it might be an interesting project to take this a step further and build out a static site generator that uses these practices and allow others to do the same. 

Planted uses two colors and one font. Images are compressed using image dithering to minimize the size of images + the overall weight of each page.
